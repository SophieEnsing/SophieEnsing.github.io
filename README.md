This study looks at the multifaceted gender inequality in the Hollywood film industry and how to visualise this in a stimulating way. A literature review describes the multifaceted gender inequality in the film industry, the importance of interaction in visualisations and it introduces the paral- lel coordinates technique. The parallel coordinates technique was used to create an interactive visualisation. The visualisation was evaluated with three participants from the study fields of Media & Culture and Gender Studies. The evaluation showed that the parallel coordinates technique is a stimulating way to visualise the gender inequality in the Hollywood film industry. Future work should be directed at developing an adaptable version of the visualisation.
